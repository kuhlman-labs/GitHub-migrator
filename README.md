## Overview

The GitHub Migrator provides an automated, scalable platform for managing large-scale GitHub-to-GitHub repository migrations. It features intelligent discovery, batch organization, detailed profiling, and comprehensive migration execution with a modern web dashboard for monitoring and control.

### Supported Migrations

**Source:**
- GitHub.com
- GitHub Enterprise Server

**Destination:**
- GitHub.com
- GitHub with data residency
- GitHub Enterprise Cloud with EMU (Managed Users)

> **Note**: Only GitHub to GitHub migrations are currently supported with plans to add support for more sources.

### Key Capabilities

- 🔍 **Automated Discovery** - Scan entire organizations or enterprises to identify and profile repositories
- 📊 **Intelligent Profiling** - Analyze size, LFS usage, submodules, large files, Actions, branch protections, and more
- 🎯 **Flexible Workflows** - Single repository, batch, bulk, and self-service migration options
- 📦 **Batch Management** - Organize into pilot groups and migration waves for controlled rollouts
- 📈 **Real-time Monitoring** - Track progress with detailed status updates through all migration phases
- 🎨 **Modern Dashboard** - Professional web UI for visualization, analytics, and control
- 🔌 **Complete REST API** - Full programmatic access for automation and CI/CD integration
- 🔐 **Dual Authentication** - PAT required for migrations; optional GitHub App for discovery with better rate limits
- 🔒 **Optional OAuth Security** - GitHub OAuth authentication with configurable org/team/enterprise access controls
- 📉 **Comprehensive Analytics** - Track metrics, completion rates, duration stats, and trends

### Why Use This Tool?

Migrating repositories at scale is complex. This tool provides:

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| **Visibility** | Know exactly what you're migrating before you start |
| **Control** | Organize migrations into manageable batches and waves |
| **Safety** | Dry-run testing and detailed validation before migration |
| **Efficiency** | Parallel processing with intelligent rate limiting |
| **Tracking** | Complete audit trail and migration history |
| **Self-Service** | Enable developers to migrate their own repositories |
| **Recovery** | Built-in rollback and retry mechanisms |

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Go** 1.21 or higher
- **Node.js** 20 or higher  
- **Git** 2.30+ with Git LFS support
- **Docker** (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Installation & Setup

**1. Clone and install dependencies:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kuhlman-labs/GitHub-migrator.git
cd GitHub-migrator
make install  # Installs Go dependencies, golangci-lint, gosec, git-sizer, and npm packages
```

**2. Configure authentication:**

```bash
# Set environment variables
export GITHUB_SOURCE_TOKEN="ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxx"  # Source system token
export GITHUB_DEST_TOKEN="ghp_yyyyyyyyyyyy"    # Destination system token
```

**Authentication Options:**

**PAT (Personal Access Token) - REQUIRED for migrations:**
- **Source**: Org admin access with `repo`, `read:user`, `admin:org` scopes
- **Destination**: Org admin access with `repo`, `admin:org`, `workflow` scopes

**GitHub App - OPTIONAL for discovery** (recommended for better rate limits):
- Provides higher rate limits for discovery and profiling operations
- PAT still used for migration operations (GitHub requirement)
- Supports two modes:
  - **With Installation ID**: Simplest setup, uses single installation token
  - **Without Installation ID**: Auto-discovers all installations, creates per-org tokens (best for multi-org apps)

See [GitHub App Setup Guide](./docs/OPERATIONS.md#github-app-authentication) for detailed configuration.

**3. Run the application:**

```bash
# Option A: Development mode (separate terminals)
make run-server  # Terminal 1 - Backend at http://localhost:8080
make web-dev     # Terminal 2 - Frontend at http://localhost:3000

# Option B: Docker
make docker-build && make docker-run  # Access at http://localhost:8080
```

### First Migration

1. **Open the dashboard** at http://localhost:3000 (or :8080 with Docker)
2. **Discover repositories** - Enter your organization name and start discovery
3. **Create a pilot batch** - Select 3-5 simple repositories for testing
4. **Run dry run** - Test without actual migration
5. **Execute migration** - Start the actual migration
6. **Monitor progress** - Watch real-time status and detailed logs

For detailed workflows, see [OPERATIONS.md](./docs/OPERATIONS.md#migration-workflows).
